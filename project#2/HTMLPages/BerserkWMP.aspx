        Berserk is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kentaro Miura. Set in a medieval Europe-inspired dark fantasy world,
        the story centers on the characters of Guts, a lone swordsman, and Griffith, the leader of a mercenary band called the "Band of the Hawk".
        The series follows Guts' journey seeking revenge on Griffith, who betrayed him and sacrificed his comrades to become a powerful demonic being.
        Miura premiered a prototype of Berserk in 1988. The series began the following year in the Hakusensha's now-defunct magazine Monthly Animal House,
        which was replaced in 1992 by the semimonthly magazine Young Animal, where Berserk has continued its publication. Following Miura's death in May 2021,
        the final chapter that he wrote and illustrated was published posthumously in September of the same year; the series resumed in June 2022,
        under supervision of Miura's fellow manga artist and childhood friend Kouji Mori and Miura's group of assistants and apprentices from Studio Gaga.

        Berserk was adapted into a 25-episode anime television series by OLM, which covered the Golden Age story arc,
        and was broadcast from October 1997 to March 1998. The Golden Age arc was also adapted into a trilogy of theatrical anime films;
        the first two films premiered in 2012 and the third film premiered in 2013.
        A second 24-episode anime television series adaptation was broadcast for two seasons in 2016 and 2017.

    <h2>A character that I like :</h2>
    <h1>Guts (Black Swordsman)</h1>
    <div>
       Guts, renowned as the "Black Swordsman", is a former mercenary and branded wanderer who travels the world in a constant internal struggle between
        pursuing his own ends and upholding his attachments to those dear to him. At one time driven solely by his will to survive, Guts finds purpose in
        life upon joining the Band of the Falcon, greatly helping in the faction's storied successes during the Hundred-Year War as captain of the band's
        raiders. He eventually becomes dissatisfied with clinging to Griffith's dream and departs from the band in pursuit of his own. Following the
        horrors of the Eclipse prompted by Griffith, Guts embarks on a two-year war against the God Hand and apostles, becoming increasingly embittered 
        on his one-track quest for retribution. He in time realizes protecting his regressed lover is more important to him, as well as something he 
        cannot do alone, and thus puts aside his quest for revenge while fostering camaraderie with new companions.

        Guts was born from the corpse of his lynched mother underneath a hanging tree, where he was left to die alone in a mire of blood and afterbirth.
        A mercenary group lead by a man named Gambino eventually happened upon the grisly site, presuming the infant to be dead. When the baby began wailing,
        to the surprise of the mercenaries, an acquaintance of Gambino's, Shisu, immediately took to the child and came to his aid. Gambino allowed the
        woman to keep Guts for her own personal consolation, despite the circumstances of Guts' birth being considered ominous by his cohorts. 
        Three years later, Guts' surrogate mother contracted the plague, dying as he watched on.[12]Under Gambino's tutelage, Guts began honing his
        swordsmanship at six years of age, and joined the mercenary's band three years later at nine years old, looking up to his leader as a father figure
        of sorts. On the night following Guts' first skirmish, a mercenary named Donovan ambushed and raped him in his tent, revealing he bought the boy
        for a night from Gambino. In a following skirmish, the young mercenary isolated Donovan and eliminated him, refusing to believe the man's claim 
        from the previous night.

        When Gambino lost his leg in battle, his relationship with Guts immediately deteriorated. From verbal to physical abuse, Guts was subjected to
        various forms of degradation for two years following Gambino's injury before Gambino eventually made an attempt on his life. Possessed of the
        notion Guts was the reason for his misfortune, Gambino revealed he did indeed sell Guts out to Donovan, voicing his disgust for the boy's existence. 
        Heavily disheartened by this revelation, Guts retaliated and killed his assailant in self-defense – the closest thing to a father he had ever known.
        Consequently attacked by Gambino's men and branded a father killer, he fled with aggressors on his tail, eventually running into a dead end and being 
        shot off a cliffside. From his high fall and a bout with a pack of wolves below, he fell unconscious, eventually being discovered by and enlisted as 
        a child soldier in another mercenary band that happened upon him.
