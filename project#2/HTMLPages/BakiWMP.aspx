    <h2>A character that I like :</h2>
    <h1>Jack Hanma</h1>
    <div>
        Jack Hanma is a fictional character from the Baki the Grappler series. He's a pitfighter from Canada and the son of Yuujirou Hanma and Diane Neil,
        a Canadian United Nations operative who Yuujirou met during the Vietnam War. Like his brother, Baki Hanma, he has since childhood wished to surpass
        his father in strength and martial ability. In the English dub of the second anime series, his name has been changed to Jack Xamma because of dub
        issues (pronounced "Zah-mah"). Jack's driving force is wanting to defeat his father, Yuujirou Hanma, to avenge his mother who was raped by him.
        After taking super steroids that made himself beyond unstable, Jack turned into a monster without balance who only cares about becoming stronger
        to take revenge.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
        Jack is an incredibly determined and stubborn person; he just doesn't know when to quit. His overtraining would be suicidal, if not for a mad
        scientist's steroid cocktails being part of his regimen. He's had his skeleton surgically restructured multiple times to get bigger. Even having
        half his face bitten off by Pickle and waking up in the hospital twice, the second time from a severe coma, he still gets up and goes right back to 
        it. Also, it can be said that he is sometimes too confident in his strength. He trains too much for his body to handle, forcing him to resort to
        steroids and other medical methods in order to keep his strength growing steadily. He is too obsessed with beating Yuujirou and avenging his mother,
        to the point where he is blinded by that dream. He doesn't know many techniques and often fights head-on. Jack doesn't care if he has to sacrifice
        his own life to achieve his goal, saying that he's always been prepared to die if he gets a body strong enough to defeat his father.

    <div>
        Jack trained so hard that his muscles became completely destroyed. He took an experimental drug known as the x4 to strengthen his body,
        regardless of a scientist warning it might kill him, he underwent extreme pain from the drug surviving due only to his Hanma blood line,
        the drug caused his muscles to become extremely large and strong. Unfortunately, a number of drugs eventually managed to destroy his body again,
        and drastically reducing his life expectancy in the process. But later, Jack managed to repair his body and he became even stronger. In the second
        series of the manga, he underwent surgery to make him taller and stronger. Kureha Shinogi carried out the operation, and thanks to that fact the 
        desired effect was achieved. Kanji Igari stated that Jack is even bigger than Mount Toba.
