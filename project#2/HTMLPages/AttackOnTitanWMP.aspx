    <h2>A character that I like :</h2>
    <h1>Levi Ackerman</h1>
    <div>
        Levi Ackerman is a fictional character from Hajime Isayama's manga series Attack on Titan. Levi is a soldier working for the Survey Corps Special
        Operations Squad , also known as Squad Levi , a squad of four elite soldiers with impressive combat records hand-picked by him.
        The squad takes the protagonist Eren Yeager under their wing as both his bodyguards and potential executors if he goes berserk.
        Though Levi is a supporting character, his backstory is explored when dealing with his former mentor Kenny during the main series as well as 
        in the spin-off manga Attack on Titan: No Regrets.

    <br />
    <div>
        Levi was based on the Watchmen character Rorschach, among other influences. In the anime adaptation of the series, Levi is voiced by Hiroshi Kamiya in
        Japanese and Matthew Mercer in English. His portrayal in No Regrets did not display major differences in characterization despite acting as his backstory.
        Critical response to Levi's character was generally positive for his supporting role with the main cast and most notably, his relationship with Kenny.
        Levi's popularity led him to win several awards and polls. His role in the prequel No Regrets also attracted generally positive reception for 
        expanding his backstory.

       Levi is known as humanity's most powerful soldier and head of an elite squad in the Survey Corps. Hange remarks that he is a bit of a "clean freak".
        Captain Kenny Ackerman later notes that the capture of Eren and Historia has to do with Levi, whom he refers to as "Levi Ackerman".
        Kenny is later revealed to be Levi's maternal uncle, who raised him after his mother Kuchel's death. Later, Levi is injured by an explosion engineered
        by Zeke Yeager (brother of Eren Jaeger). He was in a near-death state until Hange Zoe found him and escaped with his body later to make an
        alliance with Commander Theo Magath and Pieck Finger in order to take down Eren Jaeger. Eventually, Levi recovers and joins the others in battle,
        managing to kill Zeke, fulfilling his promise to Erwin in killing the Beast Titan.
