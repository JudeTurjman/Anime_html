        Death Note is a Japanese manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata.
        It was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from December 2003 to May 2006, 
        with its chapters collected in 12 tankōbon volumes. The story follows Light Yagami, a genius high school student who discovers a mysterious notebook:
        the "Death Note", which belonged to the shinigami Ryuk, and grants the user the supernatural ability to kill anyone whose name is written in its pages.
        The series centers around Light's subsequent attempts to use the Death Note to carry out a worldwide massacre of individuals whom he deems immoral 
        and to create a crime-free society, using the alias of a god-like vigilante named "Kira", and the subsequent efforts of an elite Japanese police 
        task force, led by enigmatic detective L, to apprehend him.

    <h2>A character that I like :</h2>
    <h1>L Lawliet</h1>
    <div>
        L Lawliet known mononymously as L, is a fictional character and the main antagonist in the manga series Death Note, created by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi 
        Obata. He is an enigmatic, mysterious, and highly-esteemed international consulting detective whose true identity and background is kept a secret.
        He communicates with law enforcement agencies only through his equally inexplicable handler/assistant, Watari, who serves as his official liaison
        with the authorities. Though his past is shrouded in mystery, he has gained a reputation as arguably the world's greatest detective/criminal profiler.

    <br />
    <div>
        Throughout the series, he observes and spies on the activities of the series' protagonist, Light Yagami, a high school genius. L attempts to expose
        Light as the infamous serial killer "Kira", who is responsible for massacring high-profile criminals worldwide through apparently supernatural means.
        As the series progresses, the psychological mind-game between L and Light intensifies, and each becomes bent on uncovering the other's true identity
        through a series of intricate ploys and schemes. He serves as an ideological and visual foil to Light.

        Tsugumi Ohba, the writer of the series, created L as a young adult, since he believed the story would not hold much interest if L were significantly
        older than his opponent, Light. For L's name, he wanted to use a single letter with a lot of significance; he considered "I" and "J", but eventually
        he chose "L" after careful consideration. Ohba left most of L's character design to Takeshi Obata, artist of the series. Obata asked Ohba if L could be
        "unattractive". Afterwards Ohba included ideas in his thumbnails, including L's manner of sitting, "he's English", and "he's listless".
        Ohba added details regarding L's mannerisms and his interests in sweets. Ohba credits Obata for the character designs.Obata commented that L's 
        thumbnails by Ohba had no bags under his eyes, and that he had a "plain face with no expression" which was very useful. Obata drew L as an
        "attractive young man" until chapter 11, when the character appeared in person. After chapter 11, Obata and Ohba agreed to contrast his appearance 
        with Light's.
