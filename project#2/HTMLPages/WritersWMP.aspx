    <h1>Manga</h1>
    <br />
    <div >
        Manga is an overall term used for a large range of graphic novels and comic books that has its origin in Japan.
        The term manga is derived from two Japanese words that include “man”, which means whimsical or entertaining, and “ga”, which means pictures, images, or cartoons.
        Different from the American or Western world comic books that are printed in full color, Japanese manga is always black and white. Also,
        Western cultures usually read from left to right, while Japanese manga goes from right to left.

        Takehiko Inoue is a Japanese manga artist. He is best known for the basketball series Slam Dunk (1990–1996), and the jidaigeki manga Vagabond,
        which are two of the best-selling manga series in history. Many of his works are about basketball, Inoue himself being a huge fan of the sport.
        His works sold in North America through Viz Media are Slam Dunk, Vagabond and Real, although Slam Dunk was earlier translated by Gutsoon!
        Entertainment. In 2012, Inoue became the first recipient of the Cultural Prize at the Asia Cosmopolitan Awards. Inoue was born in Isa, Kagoshima,
        and was fond of drawing since he was a child. During elementary and junior high school, Inoue joined the kendo and basketball clubs, becoming
        captain of the latter. In his third year at Kagoshima Prefectural Oguchi High School, Inoue took a summer course at an art preparatory school with
        the plan of enrolling into an art university, but such schools were too expensive so he ended up going to Kumamoto University near his hometown.
        There he majored in literature. His submission to Weekly Shōnen Jump caught the attention of editor Taizo Nakamura and, at the age of 20,
        Inoue dropped out of college to move to Tokyo and pursue a career as a manga artist.

        Yoshihiro Togashi is a Japanese manga artist. He began drawing manga at an early age, before being recognized for his talent by publishing company Shueisha while attending college.
        Togashi has authored several manga series in different genres during the past three decades. He is best known for writing and illustrating the YuYu Hakusho (1990–1994) and Hunter × Hunter
        (1998–present) series, both of which are some of the best-selling manga in history. Togashi is married to Naoko Takeuchi, the author of Sailor Moon.
        Born in Shinjō, Yamagata to a family that owned a paper shop, Togashi began drawing manga casually in his first to second year of elementary school. In high school,
        Togashi joined the fine-arts club; he later enrolled at Yamagata University where he studied education in the hope of becoming a teacher. During college he submitted some of
        his manga work to Weekly Young Jump, published by Shueisha. In 1986, at age 20, he authored a manga titled Buttobi Straight for which he received the Tezuka Award, the most prestigious
        award for new comic artists in Japan. Another manga by Togashi titled Jura no Mizuki was an honorable mention in Shueisha's first annual Hop Step Award Selection magazine,
        published in 1988. After having given up his goal of becoming a teacher, Togashi was contacted by an editor of Weekly Shōnen Jump during his senior year of college,
        who asked him to move to Tokyo.

        Kentaro Miura was a Japanese manga artist. He was best known for his acclaimed dark fantasy series Berserk, which began serialization in 1989 and continued until his death. By 2023,
        Berserk had over 60 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. In 2002, Miura received the Award for Excellence at the sixth Tezuka
        Osamu Cultural Prize. Miura was born on July 11, 1966, in Chiba, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. In 1976, at the age of 10, he created his first manga, entitled Miuranger,
        which was published for his classmates in a school publication; the series ended up spanning 40 volumes. In 1977, Miura created his second manga,
        Ken e no Michi , in which he used India ink for the first time. When he was in middle school in 1979, his drawing techniques improved greatly as he started using professional drawing
        techniques. While in high school in 1982, Miura enrolled in an artistic curriculum, where he and his classmates started publishing their works in school booklets.
        There, he befriended his later fellow manga artist Kouji Mori . They both co-authored a science fiction doujinshi which was sent to Weekly Shōnen Sunday,
        but was shot down in the last round of selections. At age 18, Miura briefly worked as an assistant to George Morikawa, of Hajime no Ippo fame. Morikawa quickly acknowledged Miura's
        high artistic level and dismissed him, saying there was nothing he could teach that Miura did not already know. By then, Miura had a dark warrior with a gigantic sword already
        illustrated in his portfolio.

        Eiichiro Oda is a Japanese manga artist and the creator of the series One Piece. With more than 523.2 million tankōbon copies in circulation worldwide,
        One Piece is both the best-selling manga in history and the best-selling comic series printed in volume, in turn making Oda one of the best-selling fiction authors.
        The series' popularity resulted in Oda being named one of the manga artists that changed the history of manga.Since November 7, 2004, Eiichiro Oda has been married
        to Chiaki Inaba , a former model and actress whom he met in late 2003 during Jump Festa festival 2004. Oda and Inaba have had two daughters; 
        the eldest was born in mid-2006 and the youngest in 2009.
        Eiichiro Oda was born on January 1, 1975, in Kumamoto, Japan. At the age of four he resolved to become a manga artist in order to avoid having to get a "real job".
        His biggest influence is Akira Toriyama and his series Dragon Ball. He recalls that his interest in pirates was probably sparked by the popular TV
        animation series titled Vicky the Viking. He submitted a character named Pandaman for Yudetamago's classic wrestling manga Kinnikuman.
        Pandaman was not only used in a chapter of the manga but would later return as a recurring cameo character in Oda's own works.
