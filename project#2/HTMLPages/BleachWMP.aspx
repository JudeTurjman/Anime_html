        Bleach is a Japanese anime television series based on Tite Kubo's original manga series of the same name.
        It was produced by Studio Pierrot and directed by Noriyuki Abe. The series aired on TV Tokyo from October 2004 to March 2012,spanning 366 episodes.
        The story follows the adventures of Ichigo Kurosaki after he obtains the powers of a Soul Reaper—a death personification similar to the Grim Reaper—from another Soul Reaper,Rukia Kuchiki.
        His newfound powers force him to take on the duties of defending humans from evil spirits and guiding departed souls to the afterlife.
        In addition to adapting the manga series it is based on, the anime periodically includes original self-contained storylines and characters not found in the source material.

        Viz Media obtained foreign television and home video distribution rights to the Bleach anime in March 2006.
        Bleach was broadcast in the United States on Adult Swim from September 2006 to November 2014. Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War, a sequel series covering the manga's final story arc, also animated by Pierrot and directed by Tomohisa Taguchi,
        aired its first 13-episode cour on TV Tokyo from October to December 2022. The second 13-episode cour aired from July to September 2023.
        The third cour is set to premiere in 2024.

        The series adapts Kubo's manga with the main story arcs and introduces anime exclusive ones. In Karakura Town, high school student Ichigo Kurosaki 
        becomes a substitute Soul Reaper (死神, Shinigami, literally, "Death God"), when Rukia Kuchiki risks her life to protect him from a Hollow. Although
        initially reluctant to accept his responsibility, he takes her place, and during this time they discover that a few classmates are spiritually
        aware and have their own powers: Quincy survivor Uryū Ishida uses spiritual particles, Orihime Inoue has a group of protective spirits called Shun
        Shun Rikka and Yasutora Sado ("Chad") has strength equal to the Hollows encased in his arm.

    <h2>A character that I like :</h2>
    <h1>Kenpachi Zaraki</h1>
    <div>
        Kenpachi Zaraki is a fictional character of support in the anime and manga series Bleach created by Tite Kubo. He is the captain of the 11th
        Division within the Gotei 13. His lieutenant is Yachiru Kusajishi.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
        Kenpachi has a wild and aggressive appearance, fitting with his personality. He wears his captain's jacket without sleeves, and with a more ragged 
        look to it. He acquired his Haori from the previous 11th Division captain, whom he defeated and killed in a duel in order to become captain. 
        He styles his hair into liberty spikes with bells at the tips, which, Tite Kubo has remarked, makes his hair one of the most difficult to draw 
        in the series.[1] He also wears a special eyepatch on his right eye lined with a strange creatures mouths; the eyepatch was created by the 12th
        Division. It absorbs the bulk of his power. Both of these are meant to give enemies an advantage, similar to his habit of fighting one-handed,
        since in an unhandicapped state he would defeat them so quickly that he would not be able to enjoy himself sufficiently to delve into a state of
        bloodlust, that being what he treasures most. He has a huge scar on the left side of his face, which was given to him as a child from his first 
        ever battle with Retsu Unohana.
    <br />
    <br />
    <div>
        Despite his initial introduction as a lethal foe, Zaraki later begins to play the role of the antihero in Bleach: though still self-centered and
        violent, his actions tend to be for the best and his relationship with his division and others. This shift is primarily centered around his
        appearances in the Bleach anime and omake stories, with the exception of the occasional diatribe between himself and Yachiru. He is depicted as
        having a very poor sense of direction, and is often depicted in omake stories asking his lieutenant Yachiru for directions to a particular place 
        (who then randomly points in a direction even though she herself has a terrible sense of direction as well).
    <br />
    <br />
    <div>
        Kenpachi lives for battle (evidenced by his method of attaining his rank) and enjoys a good fight more than anything. He restrains himself in battle 
        in order to prolong and savor the fight. Kenpachi believes that injury and death are nothing more than the price one pays for a good fight. 
        Despite his squad's reputation as the most bloodthirsty of the Gotei 13, they have their own code of ethics, different from the set rules of
        Soul Society, fitting with Zaraki's portrayal as a free spirit. On various occasions, Kenpachi is seen putting fun before work. Despite his violent 
        tendencies, Zaraki will usually give up on a fight if his opponent is too injured to fight back, claiming that the fight is no longer fun. However,
        he will unhesitatingly kill his opponent if they refuse to end their fight on his terms as seen during his battles with Tōsen and Nnoitora.
