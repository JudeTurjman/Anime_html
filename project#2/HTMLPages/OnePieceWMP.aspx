    <h2>A character that I like :</h2>
    <h1>Trafalgar D. Water Law</h1>
    <div>
        Trafalgar D. Water Law, more commonly known as just Trafalgar Law, is the Captain of the Heart Pirates and a major character in One Piece.
        He is as a supporting character in the Paramount War Saga, the deuteragonist of the Dressrosa Saga, and a major supporting character in the Yonko Saga.
        Both a friendly rival towards Luffy and hostile towards Eustass Kid, he is an infamous rookie pirate and the captain of the Heart Pirates,
        who hail from the North Blue. He is part of the group of pirates known as the Worst Generation, and is a former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea.

        Law originally formed an alliance with the Straw Hats of taking down one of the Four Emperors, Kaido, with the original sole intent of defeating his
        archenemy, Donquixote Doflamingo, and shutting down his SMILE operation. He extended his goal to overthrow another member of the Four Emperors
        when he decided of taking down Big Mom as well. With Doflamingo, Kaido and Big Mom defeated, Law officially ended his alliance with Luffy and 
        continued to set out his journey on his own with his crew. When reaching Winner Island, Law would later find himself ambushed and conflicted with
        Blackbeard, who sought out to claim the Road Poneglyphs from him now that Big Mom and Kaido are gone. Law was defeated and lost most of his crew 
        as well his submarine is destroyed. Blackbeard was going to kill Law to steal Ope Ope no Mi (whether sell it or using its powers to become immortal).
        Luckily, Law escaped with the help of his remaining crewmate, Bepo.
