        Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto.
        It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village.
        The story is told in two parts: the first is set in Naruto's pre-teen years (volumes 1–27), and the second in his teens (volumes 28–72).
        The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).

        Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from September 1999 to November 2014,
        with its chapters collected in 72 tankōbon volumes. Part I of the manga was adapted into an anime television series by Pierrot and Aniplex,
        which ran for 220 episodes from October 2002 to February 2007 on TV Tokyo;
        the English dub of the series aired on Cartoon Network and YTV from September 2005 to December 2009. A second series,
        which adapts material from Part II of the manga, is titled Naruto: Shippuden and ran on TV Tokyo for 500 episodes from February 2007 to March 2017.
        The English dub of Shippuden was broadcast on Disney XD in the United States from October 2009 to November 2011,
        airing the first 98 episodes before eventually switching over to Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in January 2014,
        starting over from the first episode. After Disney XD removed the series from broadcast,
        Viz Media began streaming new English dubbed episodes on their streaming service Neon Alley in from December 2012 to March 2016,
        starting at episode 99 and ending at episode 338 due to the service's shutdown. Besides the anime television series,
        Pierrot also developed 11 animated films and 12 original video animations (OVAs). Other Naruto-related merchandise includes light novels,
        video games, and trading cards developed by several companies.

        Viz Media licensed the manga and anime for North American production and serialized Naruto in their digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine.
        The anime series began airing in the United States and Canada in 2005, and in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2006 and 2007, respectively.
        The films and most OVAs from the series were also released by Viz, with the first film premiering in movie theaters.
        The story of Naruto continues with Naruto's son, Boruto Uzumaki, in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations:
        Boruto wishes to create his own ninja way instead of following his father's.

        Naruto is one of the best-selling manga series in history having 250 million copies in circulation worldwide in 47 countries and regions,
        with 153 million copies in Japan alone and remaining 97 million copies elsewhere. It has become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series;
        their English translations of the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller list several times,
        and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga's character development, strong storylines,
        and well-executed action sequences, though some felt the latter slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga,
        which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural references from Japanese mythology and Confucianism.

    <h2>A character that I like :</h2>
    <h1>Itachi Uchiha</h1>
    <div>
        Itachi Uchiha is a character in the Naruto manga and anime series created by Masashi Kishimoto. Itachi is the older brother of Sasuke Uchiha,
        and is responsible for killing all the members of their clan, sparing only Sasuke. He appears working as a terrorist from the organisation Akatsuki
        and serves as Sasuke's greatest enemy. During the second part of the manga, Itachi becomes involved in attacks to ninjas possessing tailed-beast 
        creatures (Jinchuriki) until facing Sasuke in a one-on-one battle. Although Itachi perishes during the final duel, it is later revealed that Itachi
        had a secret reason for assassinating the Uchiha clan. Itachi is a playable character in most of the video games from the series.

    <br />
    <div>
        Itachi's character has been popular with readers of the manga, and has been positively received by critics. His appearance as an antagonist has been
        praised by several writers, although some have considered his initial appearance to be unsurprising. The gradual revelations of his past and its 
        impact on the story has also received positive reception, and his fights were noted to be "one of the best" in the series. Numerous types of
        merchandise have been released in Itachi's likeness, including keychains, plush dolls and figurines.

        Itachi is a member of the Uchiha Clan from the village of Konohagakure and the elder brother of Sasuke Uchiha. He grew up as the child prodigy of
        the Uchiha clan, establishing milestones for not only Sasuke, but also for future Uchiha to live up to. His early childhood was marred by war,
        the violence of which caused him to seek peace at any cost. Upon learning that his clan was planning a coup d'état to take control of Konoha,
        after his clan was accused of attacking the village with the Nine-Tails, Itachi provides Konoha with intelligence on his clan's actions during
        his two years as a member of the ANBU. Over time, Itachi distances himself from his clan, as some clan members believed he murdered his best friend,
        Shisui Uchiha, to gain the Mangekyo Sharingan (万華鏡写輪眼, Mangekyo Sharingan, lit. "Kaleidoscope Copy Wheel Eye").
