    <h2>A character that I like :</h2>
    <h1>Ryusei Shido</h1>
    <div>
        Ryusei Shido  is a contender of the Blue Lock, who currently plays for France's Paris X Gen. Shido, unlike most forwards, has no concrete dream of
        becoming the world's best striker. He instead seeks to enjoy life to the fullest by playing football. Out of the original 300 forwards chosen to be
        a part of the Blue Lock Project, Shido is an ideal candidate for the type of striker Ego strives to create. After the match against the Japan U-20 team,
        Shido ranked as one of the top players in Blue Lock.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
        Shido is a tall, tanned young man with spiky blond hair with fading pink at the tips, having two strands falling on both sides of his face. He has pink 
        colored irises with white silted pupils in them like a cat, and he is of similar height and body building to Rin Itoshi. He is very expressive and is 
        often seen with a joker-like grin or smirk. During the second half of the Japan U-20 match, Shido dons the #13 U-20 jersey with a black shirt under it
        and shorts.
    <br />
    <br />
    <div>
        Shido is an eccentric player in Blue Lock who has a strong penchant for violence or, more specifically, physical altercations. At the core of Shido's 
        personality is a drive to play football because it is a biological phenomenon that makes him feel complete. Shido scores goals to pass on his genes and 
        leave his mark on the world; it is his sole focus. He gets excited from playing high level football with other high-level players and is bored if people
        cannot make him "explode" or don't "explode" themselves. He can be considered a polar opposite of Rin Itoshi, being completely self-sufficient and
        instinctive in his football. A noticeable trait of Shido's has been his propensity for violence to get what he wants, often being unwilling to work with
        most people (if anybody at all). He seems completely aware and content with the toxicity of his behavior and only feels slight remorse once he is 
        electrocuted and locked up for being overly aggressive and threatening serious bodily injury onto others.
