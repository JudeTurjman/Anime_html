        Hunter x Hunter is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi.
        It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since March 1998,
        although the manga has frequently gone on extended hiatuses since 2006. Its chapters have been collected in 37 tankōbon volumes as of November 2022.
        The story focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss who discovers that his father, who left him at a young age, is actually a world-renowned Hunter,
        a licensed professional who specializes in fantastical pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting,
        surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals. Gon departs on a journey to become a Hunter and eventually find his father.
        Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters and encounters the paranormal.

    <h2>A character that I like :</h2>
    <h1>Ging Freecss</h1>
    <div>
       Ging Freecss is the overarching protagonist of the anime/manga series, Hunter x Hunter. He is the father of Gon Freecss.
        He is a Double Star Archaeological Hunter (though he can apply for a Triple Star License), and a former Zodiac with the codename Boar
        (亥, Inoshishi). Finding Ging is Gon's motivation for becoming a Hunter. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Hiroki Tōchi and by Urara Takano
        as a child in the 1999 version while Rikiya Koyama provided his voice in the 2011 version. In the English dub,
        he was voiced by Ben Jeffrey and Elinor Holt as a child, who also provided the voice of his own son while Marc Diraison provided his voice
        in the 2011 version. 
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
        Ging has a shy and stubborn personality, to the point that he only wants Gon to meet him alone and claims that it would be cowardly of Gon 
        to bring a friend to meet him, causing one of his friends to wonder if he is afraid of crowds. Notably he avoids Zodiac meetings that lack any
        importance, and only attended a conference hosted during the Chairman Election to show he was taking it seriously.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
        Judging by his actions at the New Hunter Chairman Election to ensure Netero's will be carried out, he seems to respect the late Chairman considerably.
        Despite this negative trait, he can be a pretty decent guy all things considered. He set up ruin excavations and preservation projects out of his 
        own pocket, treated Razor, a criminal and murderer like a human being which deeply touched Razor, and after one of Beyond's team told him that
        the reason he needed money was to care for his sick sister and make sure she would be OK even if the he dies following Ging, Ging's response was,
        "Sorry, but after hearing that, there's no way I can let you die".
